# Preparation for Mastercard Senior Software Engineer Interview

## Interview Process Overview
- Multiple rounds: phone screen, technical interviews, behavioral interviews (3–4 rounds, sometimes back-to-back)
- Technical rounds: coding tests (Java/algorithms/data structures), system/design questions (distributed systems, API design, scalability, microservices), debugging/code review, exception handling, JPA, CI/CD, automation, cloud/DevOps topics, caching (internal/external, Redis, CDN)
- Behavioral/managerial rounds: STAR-format questions, teamwork, leadership, scenario-based problem solving
- Panel/group interviews: sometimes multiple interviewers in a single session
- Case studies: may be asked to design or walk through a real-world system or a project

## Sample Questions
- Core Java: exception handling, JPA, CI/CD, automation
- Distributed systems: caching, Redis, CDN, microservices patterns
- Design: design a book library API, discuss scalability, idempotency in APIs
- Coding: write code for a singly linked list (without collections), fix errors in a code sample
- API: HTTP methods (PUT, PATCH, POST), difference between filters and interceptors
- General: popular design patterns, system design, debugging

## Preparation Tips
1. Brush up on Java (or your main language): focus on exception handling, collections, JPA, concurrency
2. Practice system design: distributed systems, caching strategies, scalability, microservices
3. Review DevOps/CI-CD basics: automation, pipelines, deployment strategies
4. Coding practice: LeetCode, HackerRank, or similar platforms for algorithms/data structures
5. Behavioral prep: STAR-format answers for teamwork, leadership, conflict resolution
6. Project walkthrough: be ready to explain architecture and design decisions of recent projects
7. Ask clarifying questions: for design/coding questions, clarify requirements and constraints before starting

## Additional Notes
- The process can be lengthy and sometimes communication is slow
- Some candidates report unprofessional follow-up, so be proactive in communication
- Difficulty is rated average to difficult; expect in-depth technical and design discussions

Good luck!
