## Questions

1. Can you walk me through your career progression and what motivated your moves between roles?

**Answer:**
I decided to start with NICE since this is a fairly big and well organized company with a lot of possibilities and content going on and seemed like a good place to learn.
For my first position I started in a more customer facing team, handling tickets and solving bugs from the field.
I learned about NICE's CTI components which was very interesting.
After 1.5 years in that role I asked to move to a team in which I will have the option to develop new things from scratch, to evolve in my software design capabilities.
I then worked on a new service which exposed APIs for customer applications and that product went with me to another team developing Real Time Voice Authentication, to which I also added APIs to that service.

Then I felt I had enough in NICE and wanted to explore further enterprise companies and different techniques and products, so I moved to Varonis.
There I learned about the world of Windows security mechanism, and worked in different teams and various products under the group, all with the common theme of automating the administrative operations for handling windows security.
The way things worked in Varonis was different in NICE in that were very strong technical people to learn from, and things were more directed from above. I learned a lot from them and I feel this period in my carreer took my coding and design practices into higher levels.

Then I decided I need a break in my life to be more with my elderly mom who is sick, and that I would also take that chance to pursuit my interest in the stock market in a more serious manner.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. Can you elaborate on what you enjoyed most about working in both NICE and Varonis?
   - **Short Answer:** What I liked about working in both NICE and Varonis is that they are big and well organized companies. The variety of products, opinions and technologies is enriching and provides a wide glance to the industry and practices.
   <!-- Feedback: Clear and positive. Shows appreciation for large-scale environments and learning opportunities. Could be even stronger with a specific example of a product or technology that was especially impactful. -->
2. What specific skills or experiences were you hoping to gain with each move, and do you feel you achieved those goals?
   - **Short Answer:** I wanted to be more proficcient in software design. Moving from the first team I was in at NICE and to the more RnD oriented teams was certainly what I expected from it. Then the moved to Varonis proved itself as a good choice since the technical leadership was strong and I learned a lot from them.
   <!-- Feedback: Good self-awareness and motivation. Shows intentional career moves. Watch for typos ("proficcient", "moved"). Could briefly mention a specific skill or design pattern learned. -->
3. How do you feel your career break has influenced your perspective on your career and your approach to work? (See also Q2 below)
   - **Short Answer:** The break was less about getting perspective on my carerer in software, and more about doing other things I had to and wanted to. I seek to return from it into similar work places as were in before it.
   <!-- Feedback: Honest and direct. It's fine to say the break was for personal reasons. Consider adding a sentence about readiness and motivation to return to work. -->
4. How did you adapt to different environments, and what did you learn from each?
   - **Short Answer:** Adapting to the different environments was natural. I always wanted to do pure RnD. Anyway there's almost always a part of the job which is customer facing and bug and tickets handling, which is ok and understood. I think it's also important to experience since it gives you the perspective of the field about how the product is, and what is important to the customer. Which is a very important aspect when developing software.
   <!-- Feedback: Shows flexibility and understanding of the value of customer feedback. Could be more concise. Consider highlighting a specific lesson learned from customer-facing work. -->
5. What kind of work environment do you feel you thrive in now?
   - **Short Answer:** I would work best in an environment which is pretty similar to these I were in. Inside an enterprise company.
   <!-- Feedback: Clear preference for enterprise environments. Could add a sentence about what you value most (e.g., mentorship, structure, innovation). -->

2. I see you took a career break recently—can you tell me more about that and what you learned during that time?

    **Answer:**
    I took the break to attend personal matters but also took the opportunity to learn about stock market trading.
    During that period AI also took a big leap in the world, and I combined my technological and software skill to develop tools that helped me in trading, in different languages and technologies - such as pinescript, python and using AI bots of different kinds.
    <!-- Feedback: Strong answer for a follow-up. Shows initiative, continuous learning, and practical application of tech skills during the break. Mentioning specific technologies is a plus. Could add a sentence about readiness to return to a software role. -->

9. How do you handle feedback and performance reviews?

    **Answer:**
    Of course I enjoy receiving good feedbacks and receiving criticism is less nice, since it points out things that I have not done to the satisfaction of my employers. However, I understand it's a crucial part of being employed and knowing what are the employer's expectations, so I'd know where to meet them.

    1) For a constructive criticism I would usually say "thank you" and take to my attention what are the things that I should keep doing more of.
        - **Feedback:** This is a mature and professional approach. Acknowledging feedback and expressing gratitude shows emotional intelligence and a willingness to improve.
    2) I think feedbacks and criticism included in it, should and can come from everybody. It's not something that is saved to happened vertically in the hierarchy, but also sideways. It's the way to get along with the environment.
        - **Feedback:** Excellent point. Openness to feedback from all directions demonstrates humility and a collaborative mindset. You might add that you also try to give constructive feedback to others when appropriate.
    3) I take it into my attention when somebody expresses what are his expectations of me and I usually remember that, because my intention is to get along with my work environment. I then adjust my actions accordingly. If I have some push back to give to the criticism I will also sound it, as this is a two-way street. I would expect my peers and managers to treat me as I treat them, which is in a respectful professional manner.
        - **Feedback:** This is a strong answer. It shows you value mutual respect and are proactive in adapting, while also being willing to communicate your own perspective.
    4) If I don't agree with the feedback I would take into consideration that I could be wrong. If unclear to me I will ask for clarification, and if I disagree I will speak my mind. But if I do find the feedback correct I would take it to my attention and adjust. Of course there's always the authority to determine the standards and practices in the work place, so the alignment should be according to that.
        - **Feedback:** Very thoughtful. This demonstrates self-awareness, openness to learning, and respect for workplace standards. It’s good to show you balance assertiveness with adaptability.

10. Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker or manager. How did you resolve it?

    **Answer:**
    During my work on the cross company libraries update I was certain that a dependency we wanted to remove was coming from a library that was handled by another member of this task force. He was saying it is not coming from there, I insisted it is, I suggested he would publish a draft version I could then load without it being published to anybody else, just so we can test this direction.
    I always tend to find the technique or test case for a claim or argument so that everybody can see the same facts without the debate being subject to stands his ground harder.

    **Feedback:**
    This is a strong example. You demonstrate a solution-oriented approach to conflict, focusing on facts and testing rather than personal opinions. Suggesting a practical experiment to resolve the disagreement shows initiative, technical skill, and a collaborative mindset. You might add that this approach helped maintain a positive working relationship and led to a clear resolution.

11. What motivates you at work?

    **Answer:**
    I am motivated by challenges and the sense of accomplishment that comes from solving complex problems and delivering high-quality software. I also value collaboration and learning from others, which is why I appreciate working in teams with strong technical leadership.

    **HR Responses:**
    1. It's great to hear that you find motivation in challenges and teamwork. Can you give an example of a challenging problem you solved that had a significant impact?
    2. You mentioned the importance of technical leadership. Have you had experiences where you had to motivate or lead others? How did you approach that?
    3. How do you maintain your motivation during repetitive or less challenging tasks?
    4. What role do you think recognition and feedback play in maintaining your motivation at work?

    **HR Follow-up Questions:**
    1. Can you describe a specific instance where you overcame a significant challenge at work?
    2. How do you handle situations when you feel unmotivated or face a setback?
    3. What strategies do you use to stay engaged and motivated in long-term projects?
    4. How important is the work culture and environment in keeping you motivated?
