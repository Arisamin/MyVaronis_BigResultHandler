## Questions

1. Can you walk me through your career progression and what motivated your moves between roles?

**Answer:**
I decided to start with NICE since this is a fairly big and well organized company with a lot of possibilities and content going on and seemed like a good place to learn.
For my first position I started in a more customer facing team, handling tickets and solving bugs from the field.
I learned about NICE's CTI components which was very interesting.
After 1.5 years in that role I asked to move to a team in which I will have the option to develop new things from scratch, to evolve in my software design capabilities.
I then worked on a new service which exposed APIs for customer applications and that product went with me to another team developing Real Time Voice Authentication, to which I also added APIs to that service.

Then I felt I had enough in NICE and wanted to explore further enterprise companies and different techniques and products, so I moved to Varonis.
There I learned about the world of Windows security mechanism, and worked in different teams and various products under the group, all with the common theme of automating the administrative operations for handling windows security.
The way things worked in Varonis was different in NICE in that were very strong technical people to learn from, and things were more directed from above. I learned a lot from them and I feel this period in my carreer took my coding and design practices into higher levels.

Then I decided I need a break in my life to be more with my elderly mom who is sick, and that I would also take that chance to pursuit my interest in the stock market in a more serious manner.

2. I see you took a career break recently—can you tell me more about that and what you learned during that time?
3. What attracted you to Varonis, and what are you most proud of from your time there?
4. How would you describe your main responsibilities and achievements in your most recent role?
5. Can you give an example of a challenging project you led or contributed to, and what the outcome was?
6. What technologies are you most comfortable with, and how do you keep your skills up to date?
7. How do you approach learning new tools or frameworks when required by a project?
8. Why are you interested in moving on from your last position, and what are you looking for in your next role?
9. How do you handle feedback and performance reviews?
10. What are your long-term career goals, and how does this position fit into them?
