## Questions

1. Can you walk me through your career progression and what motivated your moves between roles?

**Answer:**
I decided to start with NICE since this is a fairly big and well organized company with a lot of possibilities and content going on and seemed like a good place to learn.
For my first position I started in a more customer facing team, handling tickets and solving bugs from the field.
I learned about NICE's CTI components which was very interesting.
After 1.5 years in that role I asked to move to a team in which I will have the option to develop new things from scratch, to evolve in my software design capabilities.
I then worked on a new service which exposed APIs for customer applications and that product went with me to another team developing Real Time Voice Authentication, to which I also added APIs to that service.

Then I felt I had enough in NICE and wanted to explore further enterprise companies and different techniques and products, so I moved to Varonis.
There I learned about the world of Windows security mechanism, and worked in different teams and various products under the group, all with the common theme of automating the administrative operations for handling windows security.
The way things worked in Varonis was different in NICE in that were very strong technical people to learn from, and things were more directed from above. I learned a lot from them and I feel this period in my carreer took my coding and design practices into higher levels.

Then I decided I need a break in my life to be more with my elderly mom who is sick, and that I would also take that chance to pursuit my interest in the stock market in a more serious manner.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. Can you elaborate on what you enjoyed most about working in both NICE and Varonis?
   - **Short Answer:** What I liked about working in both NICE and Varonis is that they are big and well organized companies. The variety of products, opinions and technologies is enriching and provides a wide glance to the industry and practices.
   <!-- Feedback: Clear and positive. Shows appreciation for large-scale environments and learning opportunities. Could be even stronger with a specific example of a product or technology that was especially impactful. -->
2. What specific skills or experiences were you hoping to gain with each move, and do you feel you achieved those goals?
   - **Short Answer:** I wanted to be more proficcient in software design. Moving from the first team I was in at NICE and to the more RnD oriented teams was certainly what I expected from it. Then the moved to Varonis proved itself as a good choice since the technical leadership was strong and I learned a lot from them.
   <!-- Feedback: Good self-awareness and motivation. Shows intentional career moves. Watch for typos ("proficcient", "moved"). Could briefly mention a specific skill or design pattern learned. -->
3. How do you feel your career break has influenced your perspective on your career and your approach to work? (See also Q2 below)
   - **Short Answer:** The break was less about getting perspective on my carerer in software, and more about doing other things I had to and wanted to. I seek to return from it into similar work places as were in before it.
   <!-- Feedback: Honest and direct. It's fine to say the break was for personal reasons. Consider adding a sentence about readiness and motivation to return to work. -->
4. How did you adapt to different environments, and what did you learn from each?
   - **Short Answer:** Adapting to the different environments was natural. I always wanted to do pure RnD. Anyway there's almost always a part of the job which is customer facing and bug and tickets handling, which is ok and understood. I think it's also important to experience since it gives you the perspective of the field about how the product is, and what is important to the customer. Which is a very important aspect when developing software.
   <!-- Feedback: Shows flexibility and understanding of the value of customer feedback. Could be more concise. Consider highlighting a specific lesson learned from customer-facing work. -->
5. What kind of work environment do you feel you thrive in now?
   - **Short Answer:** I would work best in an environment which is pretty similar to these I were in. Inside an enterprise company.
   <!-- Feedback: Clear preference for enterprise environments. Could add a sentence about what you value most (e.g., mentorship, structure, innovation). -->

2. I see you took a career break recently—can you tell me more about that and what you learned during that time?

**Answer:**
I took the break to attend personal matters but also took the opportunity to learn about stock market trading.
During that period AI also took a big leap in the world, and I combined my technological and software skill to develop tools that helped me in trading, in different languages and technologies - such as pinescript, python and using AI bots of different kinds.
<!-- Feedback: Strong answer for a follow-up. Shows initiative, continuous learning, and practical application of tech skills during the break. Mentioning specific technologies is a plus. Could add a sentence about readiness to return to a software role. -->

**HR Follow-up Replies:**

1. That’s impressive! It’s great to see you kept your technical skills sharp and explored new technologies during your break. How do you see these new skills benefiting your next role?
