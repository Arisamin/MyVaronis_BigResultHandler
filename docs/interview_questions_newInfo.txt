NEW INFORMATION ADDED TO INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS.MD
================================================

1. In Question 1 (What happens if the BigResultHandler crashes?) - Added under the crash handling explanation:

**State Machine Implementation:**
- State machine uses State Pattern with state handler objects (e.g., AwaitingResultsStateHandler, SendingCompletionStateHandler)
- Context object is maintained across state transitions
- Context contains Transaction ID and other transaction-specific data
- State handlers are stateless - all state is in context object and external stores

**Resource Sharing:**
- KV Store and Azure Storage objects are shared across different state machine instances
- Multiple state machine instances can coexist handling different transactions
- Each instance operates on its own transaction data using unique Transaction ID
- State handlers access their data in KV Store/Storage by Transaction ID key
- This ensures data isolation between concurrent transactions

Upon crash, a new state machine instance is created for the recovered transaction, accessing the same KV Store/Storage using the persisted Transaction ID.


2. In Question 11 (How does the system scale horizontally?) - Added:

**State Machine Concurrency:**
- Multiple state machine instances can coexist within a single process
- Each state machine instance handles one transaction using its unique Transaction ID
- KV Store and Azure Storage are shared resources across all instances
- State handlers access their transaction data using Transaction ID as the key
- Context object containing Transaction ID is passed between state handlers
- No interference between concurrent transactions due to Transaction ID isolation
