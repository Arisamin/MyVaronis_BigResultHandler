My question to Gemini:
-----------------------
In November 2024 I left my job as a software engineer in C# in Varonis , as a backend developer.
since then AI tools were integrated in the software development environment in the industry.
Think like a developing team leader, and prepare a plan for me to get up to speed with the changes and the tools that the job has gone since I left so I can train and prepare myself for returning to the job market and be up to speed and equipped with the necessary skills.

Answer:
-------
Welcome back to the grid. A lot has changed in the last 15 months.

As a Team Lead, if you walked into my office today (February 2026) ready to work, I wouldn't be asking if you know C# syntax—I assume you do. I would be asking: **"How well can you orchestrate an AI Agent to build this feature for you?"**

In late 2024, AI was an "autocomplete" tool (Copilot).
In 2026, AI is an **"Agentic"** workflow. It doesn't just suggest the next line; it plans, edits multiple files, runs the terminal, and fixes its own compile errors.

Here is your "Return to Duty" training plan to bridge the gap from Nov 2024 to today.

### Phase 1: The New IDE Landscape (Day 1-2)

The biggest shock you'll face is that the "Editor" has become an "Environment." You need to get used to **Agentic IDEs**.

**The Shift:**

* **2024:** You typed code, Copilot ghost-texted the rest.
* **2026:** You open a "Composer" or "Agent" window, type *"Refactor the auth service to use JWTs and update all controllers,"* and the AI edits 15 files at once. You are now the *Reviewer*, not just the *Writer*.

**Action Items:**

1. **Install "Cursor" (or Windsurf):**
* Even if you are a die-hard Visual Studio user, you *must* try **Cursor** (a VS Code fork). It defined the 2025 meta.
* **Drill:** Use the **"Composer" (Ctrl+I)** feature. Don't write the code. Paste a requirement doc and let it generate the project structure, classes, and tests in one go.


2. **Update Visual Studio 2025:**
* If you return to a corporate enterprise (like Varonis), you'll likely use VS 2025.
* Enable **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**. It can now run terminal commands and fix build errors automatically.
* **Drill:** Intentionally break your code (syntax error). Don't fix it. Ask Copilot in the terminal to "Fix the build." Watch it read the error, find the file, and apply the fix.



### Phase 2: The .NET AI Stack (Day 3-5)

The C# ecosystem standardized how we talk to AI models in 2025. You need to know these libraries to build modern backends.

**1. `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` (The New Standard):**

* In 2024, every library (LangChain, Semantic Kernel) had its own way of chatting with LLMs.
* Now, we use `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`. It's the `IChatClient` interface that unifies everything.
* **Task:** Build a simple Console App that uses `IChatClient` to swap between OpenAI (GPT-4) and a local model (Ollama) without changing your business logic.

**2. Semantic Kernel (The Orchestrator):**

* This is still the heavy hitter for enterprise apps.
* **What's new:** "Agents" and "Planners" are much more stable.
* **Task:** Write a "Plugin" (a C# class with `[KernelFunction]` attributes) that lets the AI query a mock SQL database.

**3. Model Context Protocol (MCP):**

* This is the buzzword of late 2025. It's a standard that lets AI tools (like Cursor or Claude) connect to *your* data (Postgres, GitHub, Slack) securely.
* **Task:** Read up on how to connect a local MCP server to your IDE so the AI knows your database schema without you pasting it into the chat.

### Phase 3: The "Reviewer" Mindset (Day 6-7)

Your value as a Senior Engineer has shifted. Junior devs + AI can write code fast, but they write *insecure* or *hallucinated* code fast.

**The New Skill: AI Code Review**

* **Security:** AI loves to hallucinate packages that don't exist or use deprecated methods. You need to spot "lazy" AI patterns (e.g., catching generic `Exception`, skipping input validation).
* **Context Limit Blindness:** AI forgets what it wrote 5 files ago. You need to be the "Architect" who ensures the `UserConfig` class in file A actually matches the `DatabaseSchema` in file B.

### Phase 4: The Capstone Project

To declare yourself "ready," build this weekend project using the 2026 stack:

**The Project:** "Smart Log Analyzer"

1. **Backend:** .NET 9 Web API.
2. **AI Integration:** Use `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` to analyze incoming log text.
3. **Vector Search:** Use **Postgres with pgvector** (the standard for memory now). Store log embeddings so you can ask: *"Has this error happened before?"*
4. **The Rule:** You are **not allowed** to write the boilerplate manually. You must prompt your IDE to scaffold the Controller, Service, and Repository. You only write the complex business logic and review the PR.

### Summary Checklist for your Resume/Interview

* [ ] "Proficient with **Agentic IDE workflows** (Cursor/VS 2025)."
* [ ] "Experience with **Microsoft.Extensions.AI** and **Semantic Kernel**."
* [ ] "Familiar with **RAG** implementation using **pgvector**."
* [ ] "Ability to lead **AI-assisted Code Reviews**."

Welcome back. The tools are faster, but they still need a pilot. Good luck.

## Key Skills Summary & Technical Drills (2026 AI IDE Era)

### Key Skills to Focus On

- **Agentic IDE Proficiency:** Confidently use agent-driven features in Cursor, VS 2025, or similar. Know how to prompt, review, and direct multi-file AI edits.
- **Modern .NET AI Stack:** Hands-on with `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`, `IChatClient`, and Semantic Kernel plugins/skills.
- **AI Code Review:** Spot hallucinated code, security issues, and context mismatches in AI-generated PRs.
- **RAG & Vector Search:** Understand Retrieval-Augmented Generation, use of pgvector/Postgres for semantic search.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Know how to connect IDEs/agents to local and cloud data sources securely.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Write clear, testable, and context-rich prompts for agentic workflows.
- **Orchestration & Automation:** Use AI to scaffold, refactor, and test codebases, not just autocomplete.

### Technical Drills

1. **AI IDE Mastery**
	- Use Cursor or VS 2025 to: scaffold a new project, refactor a service, and fix a build error using only agentic commands.
	- Practice reviewing and accepting/rejecting multi-file AI PRs.

2. **.NET AI Integration**
	- Build a .NET 9 console/web app that swaps between OpenAI and local LLMs using `IChatClient`.
	- Write a Semantic Kernel plugin that exposes a business function to the AI.

3. **RAG & Vector Search**
	- Set up Postgres with pgvector locally. Store and query embeddings from .NET.
	- Build a simple RAG demo: ask a question, retrieve relevant docs, and summarize with AI.

4. **MCP & Secure Data Access**
	- Connect your IDE to a local database using MCP. Practice granting/revoking access and seeing how the agent uses schema/data context.

5. **AI Code Review Simulation**
	- Intentionally introduce a security bug or deprecated API in a codebase. Use the AI agent to review and suggest fixes—then manually verify.

6. **Prompt Engineering**
	- Write prompts for: refactoring, test generation, and bug fixing. Compare results and iterate for clarity and completeness.

7. **Capstone Challenge**
	- Build the "Smart Log Analyzer" project (see above) using only agentic workflows for all boilerplate and infrastructure.
